I start by making a blender cylinder
I created it using 30 sides so I could cleanly divide it in 6 slot faces
painted a different colored dot on each slot face
export as a glb

threw the model in hyperfy and adjusted the scale/rotation until its default scale/rotation was correct (I don't want to scale in the app code)
in hyperfy I add 3 of the cylinders and position them relative to 0,0,0 in world space so they're the correct height and spaced apart from eachother
I can copy these position offsets into my model objects in my code and they will be positioned correctly

next step is to copy the treasure chest app (so I have some base, and it has a tween script that I'll use)
I just cleared everything out of the app and added 3 wheels and the cubes using my dry fit positons/scales
dry fitting a cube with the "no model" cube didn't work so I had to readjust the cube positions/scales
manually adjust cubes until it looks good enough

now to the code:
set a hard-coded spinSpeed
set a hard-coded spinBaseRotation - basically 360 * some number of full spins we want to do
the smaller cube will have an onClick function
    if spinStartTime is not zero (means we are currently Spinning)
        return early (this prevents multiple clicks)
    randomly select a number between 1-6 for each face
    dispatch the combination across the network, plus a time spinStartTime
run a useeffect function whenever spinStartTime is updated
    {
        if spinStartTime is zero (the world updates will end before this so its not useless)
            return early
        play spin sound
            basically if isPlaying, do nothing, else play()
        set tween from current rotation to the new combination number * 60 + spinBaseRotation
        return world onupdate()
        {
            if worldtime - spinStartTime > spinSpeed
                stop spin sound
                if all 3 numbers of the spincombination are the same 
                    play win sound
                else
                    play lose sound
                set each wheel rotation to combination number(0-5) * 60 (basically the same position except between 0-360 so the next spin also rotates the full amount)
                dispatch a new spinStartTime of 0 - this will trigger the onupdate to unsubscribe
            else
                progress tween by the worldtime - spinStartTime
                rotate to tween rotation amount
        }
    }
initial spintime = 0
